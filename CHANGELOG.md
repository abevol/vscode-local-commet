# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- Storage path updated: by default, local comment data is now created under `.vscode/` in the current project; legacy data can be migrated from the global directory to this project path.

- Import/export improved: you can copy storage files (e.g. `.vscode/local-comment/comments/comments.json`) into the same path under `.vscode/` in a new project instead of using the import/export commands in the Command Palette.

- Multi-group local comments: you can use multiple comment groups by opening Local Comment settings and choosing a different comment config file (e.g. a different `comments.json` or custom `.json` in the comments folder) to switch between groups.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Allow adjusting the font size of Markdown editor rendering in editor settings; it now defaults to match the code editor font size

### Changed
- Adjusted styles on the Markdown input page: removed the drag-to-resize input area (no longer needed), improved the basic feature hint icons
- Adjusted some styles on the Code Corner login page
- Adjusted some documentation structure

### Friendly reminder
- In the next version, the file save path will be changed. A path like `.vscode/vscode-local-comments/comments/comments.json` will be created under the project. The data read priority for local comments will be: `.vscode/vscode-local-comments/comments/comments.json` > `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/vscode-local-comment/projects/`. **Project-local storage path has higher priority than the global storage path.** A data migration option will be provided. **For data safety, please back up and export your data regularly to avoid loss.**
